## 📘 Overview

This repository contains my undergraduate honours thesis:  
**“Stability Analysis of Marginally Outermost Trapped Surfaces (MOTS) Using Spectral Methods”**.

The project explores the **stability of MOTS**, key structures in general relativity associated with black holes. Using a combination of **symbolic computation** and **numerical spectral methods**, this work analyzes how these surfaces respond to perturbations—offering insight into black hole dynamics.

## 🧠 Key Concepts

- **MOTS (Marginally Outer Trapped Surfaces)** in general relativity
- **Spectral methods** for solving differential equations
- **Eigenvalue analysis** of a stability operator
- **Python-based implementation** for symbolic and numerical computation

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python
- SymPy (symbolic computation)
- NumPy / SciPy (numerical linear algebra)
